# üìä Employment Analytics Dashboard for data roles

## üîç Overview

The **Employment Analytics Dashboard** features a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) designed to provide users with an intuitive, engaging, and data-driven exploration of the job market. This interactive platform presents a comprehensive overview of key employment trends, including salary variations, industry distributions, and job availability across different sectors. With a strong emphasis on usability, comparability, and interactivity, the interface empowers users to navigate complex employment data effortlessly. It allows for seamless filtering, detailed analysis, and insightful data visualization, enabling users to extract meaningful patterns and make informed decisions based on real-time job market dynamics.

The dashboard is designed to enable users to efficiently analyze and compare employment trends across different job roles and industries. Through interactive data visualizations, users can explore salary distributions, identifying variations between positions and sectors to make well-informed career or hiring decisions. The inclusion of dynamic filters enhances the user experience, allowing seamless navigation through specific job roles, industries, and skill sets. Beyond salary comparisons, the dashboard also highlights outliers, making it easy to spot the highest and lowest-paying roles at a glance. Additionally, skill-based salary insights provide valuable information on how technical skills such as Python, SQL, and Tableau impact earning potential.

## üìÅ Project Contents

### 1. **Data Files**
These are the final, cleaned datasets derived from the original raw data through validation and transformation steps:

- **`[job_data.xlsx]`** ‚Äì [Description of this file: This file contains parameters like company name, industry, headquaters, job location, avg salary, job title, skills and may important parameters. It is used as the primary dataset for the employment dashboard on data roles. Example: "Contains salary data by industry and job role, positions by location, by sectors, by industry and many others."]
- **`[postings.xlsx]`** ‚Äì [Description of this file: This file contains parameters like job type, company name, industry, headquaters, job location, avg salary, job title, skills and may important parameters. It is used as the seconadary dataset for the employment dashboard on data roles. Example: "Contains salary data by industry and job role, positions by location, by sectors, by industry and many others."]


### 2. **Code Files**
This includes all scripts used for data cleaning, transformation, and validation:

- **`data_cleaning_and_validation.py`** ‚Äì Python script that:
  - Cleans missing/null values
  - Performs data type validation
  - Aggregates monthly counts to yearly totals
  - Saves final output as CSV


### 3. **Application**
The application allows users to interact with the final dataset via:
- A **Power BI Dashboard** (exported `.pbix` file)
- Dashboard published Link: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjhhMjg0NDItODJlYy00ZTk0LTkwNTYtZWM5MjY3YTAwZTllIiwidCI6IjJjNGE2MDYzLTQ0MTAtNDQwMi1hZjUzLTI2NThlZGExNTFkMiJ9

## ‚úÖ Validation and Transformation Steps

Key steps taken to ensure the data is clean and usable:

* Removed rows with missing or corrupt values.
* Validated data types (e.g., integers for count fields, dates formatted correctly).
* Aggregated monthly data to generate annual summaries.
* Filtered out non-relevant categories (e.g., data with null states).
* Created new fields where necessary (e.g., `total_checks_per_year`).

## üìå Notes

* All final versions of the data, scripts, and app files are located in the `/final` folder.
* \[Include any assumptions, limitations, or special configurations used.]
